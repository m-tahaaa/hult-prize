          Team 'Morph' was adjudged the 2nd Runner-up at the first Hult Prize OnCampus Finals at
          NIT Durgapur. Comprising of 2nd year students, Devansh Goyal, Raj Gaurav, Aniket Verma and
          Pushpanjali Bharti, their idea was to directly link farmers with local restaurants, thus
          eliminating the middlemen in between and creating value and empowerment for both the farmers
          and the local restaurants.
